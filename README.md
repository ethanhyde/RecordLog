# Record-Log

'Record-Log' is a project initially created for the course CS 422 at University of Oregon.

# Purpose

The purpose of this software is to provide deejays, musicians, and music fans a centralized space to track the music they listen to, how they feel about it, and how it relates to other music they've encountered. These relations can be used to build interesting, thematically driven playlists, smoothly transitioned sets, and to keep a customizable diary of all the songs they want to remember.

# How to use

Follow the installation instruction found in installation_instructions.txt to install necessary libraries and dependencies, make sure you have Homebrew installed, refer to instructions for more information.
